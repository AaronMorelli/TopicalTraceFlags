Flags in this category fall into the below groupings:

#. `Allocation`_ --> Flags that modify how pages in MDF/NDF files are allocated to individual objects.
#. `Other`_ --> Functionality toggles not related to page allocation.
#. `Fixes and Past Relevance`_ --> Fix flags and flags which are no longer relevant.

TODO: 3028 may need to be moved to a fix flag section, ditto for 3057, 3111, 3117 
TODO: 3607 should at least be referenced in the TranLog Recovery section, and in the CheckDB Corruption section.
TODO: 9958 should at least be referenced in the TranLog Recovery section

.. _272:

272
	Connect: "In SQL Server 2012 the implementation of the identity property has been changed to accommodate 
	investments into other features. In previous versions of SQL Server the tracking of identity generation 
	relied on transaction log records for each identity value generated. In SQL Server 2012 we generate identity 
	values in batches and log only the max value of the batch. This reduces the amount and frequency of information 
	written to the transaction log improving insert scalability. If you require the same identity generation 
	semantics as previous versions of SQL Server there are two options available:
		- Use trace flag 272. This will cause a log record to be generated for each generated identity value. The performance of identity generation may be impacted by turning on this trace flag.
		- Use a sequence generator with the NO CACHE setting. This will cause a log record to be generated for each generated sequence value. Note that the performance of sequence value generation may be impacted by using NO CACHE."

	Later in the Connect discussion, one commenter notes that when adding the TF as a startup flag, the flag only 
	appears to work when using the "lowercase t" syntax rather than the more common "uppercase T" syntax.

.. _FixPastRel1:

Fixes and Past Relevance
------------------------
These flags either are old and irrelevant for modern builds, appear only in CTPs, or enable a 
fix in a CU but are baselined in a later service pack or release.

.. _1140:

1140
	Workaround for a bug in 2005SP2/SP3 and SQL 2008 where mixed page allocations climb continually, 
	due to a change in the way that mixed-page allocations are done. KB has a great description 
	of both the "old" and "new" way that free pages are found for a mixed-page allocation to be performed.
