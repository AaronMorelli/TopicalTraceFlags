The following additions or modifications are newer to this repository. Checking this page periodically can serve
as a "news digest" for new flags in the product, or changes to existing flags. Note that the same :doc:`Disclaimers <core/Disclaimers>`
apply here as to the repository as a whole: this content is only a best-effort. Flags announcements could slip by 
unnoticed to the maintainer and contributors of this repo. Doing your own homework is essential for any big decisions
you are making to your environments.
